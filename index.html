<h1>Greetings, traveller!</h1>
<h2>Take a seat, let me tell you something about myself.</h2>
<div class="d">
<p>As a child I had a passion for computers and video games, and I played hundreds if not thousands of them. I asked myself “How does one make a game?”. Through my curiosity I experimented, first with interactive comic books I created for my friends in elementary school, and then with many simple projects in different game engines. I watched countless documentaries, tutorials and interviews. </p>   
<p>My <i>"serious"</i> steps towards my career began when I attended game design courses by <b>Code Week Montenegro</b> and <b>Amplitudo Akademija</b>. I used these opportunities to improve my skills, gain experience in 2D and 3d game design, and build up my portfolio.</p>
<p>In 2021, I was selected for the <b>PlayUK Western Balkans mentorship scheme</b>. I spent 8 weeks working alongside UK game industry professionals, refined my skills, and learned about working in the game industry.</p>
<p>Making games is something I truly love. Designing atmospheric, memorable experiences with good mechanics, believeable characters and dramatic stories is something that I strive for. When a player feels the same emotional impact and joy that I have felt many times during these years of playing and creating games, I will know that I have succeeded.</p>
</div>
<div class="d">
<p>I am always looking to improve and gain new experience. I look forward to working on ever bigger projects with like-minded and ambitious people.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps one day we will get to work together? For additional information you can find my contacts on the bottom of the page. </p>
