<h1>Greetings, traveller!</h1>
<h2>Take a seat, let me tell you something about myself.</h2>
<div class="d">
<p>Ever since I was three years old I developed a passion for computers and video games. My journey into the world of gaming started when my parents bought a computer running on Windows XP, and from there on I played hundreds, if not thousands of games of all genres. Even as a child I have always asked myself <i>“How does one make a game?”</i> and from that question I went further, watching countless documentaries, tutorials and interviews.   Through my curiosity I experimented, first with interactive comic books I used to create for my friends in elementary school where they would choose what would happen next to the main hero, and developing the comic’s stories through my friends’ choices. Afterwards, I worked on many simple projects in different game engines, including Unity and Unreal. My next “serious” steps in my career began when I applied for a Game Design course by <b>Code Week Montenegro</b> and made a complete 2D game in Unity. Next, I undertook another Game Design course by <b>Amplitudo Akademija</b>, where I built up my portfolio and gained further experience in 2D and 3D game design.</p>
